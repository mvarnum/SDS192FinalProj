## Swimming

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#wrangling
athlete_swim <- athlete_events %>% 
  filter(Sport == "Swimming") %>% 
  mutate(BMI = Weight/((Height/100)*(Height/100)))

swim_by_year <- athlete_swim %>% 
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_height = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_weight = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_BMI = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE) / ((mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE) / 100)*(mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE) / 100)) ) %>% 
  filter(avg_height != "NaN" & avg_weight != "NaN" & avg_age != "NaN")

ggplot(data = swim_by_year, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = avg_height)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.75) +
  facet_wrap(~Sex)

ggplot(data = swim_by_year, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = avg_BMI)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.75) +
  facet_wrap(~Sex)
```
```{r}
#comparing runners and swimmers BMI accross events
runner_BMI <- athlete_events %>% 
  filter(Sport == "Athletics", Year > 1990) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = Weight/((Height/100)*(Height/100))) %>% 
  filter(grepl("0", Event))

swimmer_BMI <- athlete_events %>% 
  filter(Sport == "Swimming", Year > 1990) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = Weight/((Height/100)*(Height/100)))
swimmer_BMI

ggplot(data = runner_BMI, mapping = aes(x = factor(Event), y = BMI)) +
  #facet_wrap(~grepl("Men", Event)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = swimmer_BMI, mapping = aes(x = factor(Event), y = BMI)) +
  #facet_wrap(~grepl("Men", Event)) +
  geom_boxplot()
  
```

##Weightlifting (men)
```{r, echo = FALSE}
athlete_lifting <- athlete_events %>% 
  filter(Sport == "Weightlifting" & Sex == "M" & Year > 1919) %>% 
  mutate(BMI = Weight/((Height/100)*(Height/100)))

lifting_averages_by_year <- athlete_lifting %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_weight = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
    avg_height = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE), 
    avg_BMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE))
         
ggplot(data = athlete_lifting,
       mapping = aes(x = factor(Year), y = BMI)) +
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(data = lifting_averages_by_year,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = avg_weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
  
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = gymnastics_by_year, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = avg_age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.75) +
  facet_wrap(~Sex)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = swim_by_year, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = avg_age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, span = 0.75) +
  facet_wrap(~Sex)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Men's weightlifting

lifting_averages_by_year <- athlete_lifting %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%

    avg_height = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE), 
    avg_BMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE))
