#load datasets

athlete_events <- read_csv("athlete_events.csv")
noc_regions <- read_csv("noc_regions.csv")

#data wrangling
athlete_all <- athlete_events %>% 
  filter(Sport == "Swimming" | Sport == "Gymnastics" | Sport == "Athletics") %>% 
  group_by(Year, Sex, Sport) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_height = mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_weight = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE), 
    avg_BMI = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE) / ((mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE) / 100)*(mean(Height, na.rm = TRUE) / 100)))%>% 
  filter(avg_height != "NaN" & avg_weight != "NaN" & avg_age != "NaN")

#data visualization
